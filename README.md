[00:13.96] Remember to put on silencer
[00:17.79] Exactly like our mother's words
[00:22.67] We forget about spilled wine
[00:26.15] But the stain will not be gone
[00:29.08] Though the violence is familiar
[00:32.94] And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
[00:38.02] The flavors are not yours to seize
[00:41.82] Don't ever give in please
[00:44.58] Camelia
[00:48.08] 
[00:53.67] I was the one to venture
[00:57.04] Settling only for more
[01:00.66] I've poured out my everything
[01:04.55] My everything inside
[01:08.24] With grown up eyes
[01:11.30] You'll see
[01:12.26] Some men are pigs
[01:14.01] Some girls are the same
[01:16.27] Why would their lies stop tonight
[01:32.77] 
[01:22.23] Remember to put on silencer
[01:26.48] Exactly like our mother's words
[01:31.11] We forget about spilled wine
[01:34.74] But the stain will not be gone
[01:37.62] Though the violence is familiar
[01:41.41] And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
[01:46.46] The flavors are not yours to seize
[01:50.36] Stay lively and free
[02:00.36] 
[01:52.95] Nobody is born a fighter
[01:56.71] There isn't enough space for all of us
[02:01.87] You don't have to act so tough
[02:05.32] But your focus shall never budge
[02:08.19] Everyone is really similar
[02:11.93] Strip them down to the core, the flesh and skin
[02:16.92] See how their love is thin
[02:20.87] Don't you ever give in
[02:23.59] Camelia
[02:27.09] 
[02:39.00] I pulled the trigger
[02:40.31] Bang bang
[02:42.42] Though unlike in the movies
[02:44.62] So loud it screamed
[02:47.50] We forget about killed swine
[02:50.99] But the pain will not be gone
[02:53.76] Echoing down the corridor
[02:57.66] The soul of a naked man
[03:00.04] Looking for more
[03:02.71] Looks like you still stand
[03:06.27] Let me finish you
[03:07.81] Bang bang bang
[03:14.81] 
[03:09.12] Remember to put on silencer
[03:13.14] Exactly like our mother's words
[03:17.94] We forget about spilled wine
[03:21.31] But the stain will not be gone
[03:24.25] Though the violence is familiar
[03:28.18] And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
[03:33.13] The flavors are not yours to seize
[03:37.06] Stay lively and free
[03:47.06] 
[03:39.55] Nobody is born a fighter
[03:43.59] There isn't enough space for all of us
[03:48.52] You don't have to act so tough
[03:52.36] No one can make you budge
[03:54.87] Nothing of him was particular
[03:58.65] Though somehow I was obedient 'till now
[04:03.76] See how their blood is vile
[04:07.50] Don't let yourself corrupt
[04:10.07] Camelia
